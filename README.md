# a-language-game

Implement a TranslateToPigLatin method that translates from English to Pig Latin Language, that obeys a few simple following rules:

If a word begins with a vowel sound ('a','o','e','i','u'), add an "yay" sound to the end of the word (e.g. "apple" -> "appleyay").
If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word. Consonant sounds can be made up of multiple consonants, a.k.a. a consonant cluster (e.g. "chair" -> "airchay").
The task definition is given in the XML-comments for the method.

Notes:

If a word begins with a capital letter, then its translation also begins with a capital letter, if it starts with a lowercase letter, then its translation will also begin with a lowercase letter.
Do not use regular expression.
